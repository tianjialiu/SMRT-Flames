SMRT-Flames: Smoke Management and Risk Tool with Fire-Land-Atmosphere Mapped Scenarios

[SMRT-Flames](https://smoke-policy-tool.projects.earthengine.app/view/smrt-flames) quantifies the "smoke risk" of historical and potential wildland fire emissions in the western United States on population-weighted exposure and allows end-users to explores the impact of hypothetical land management scenarios on reducing smoke risk. The smoke risk index is based on a flexible framework that includes fire history and activity, emissions factors, atmospheric transport, and land cover. SMRT-Flames allows land managers to prioritize prescribed burns and fuel treatments to minimize the long-term population smoke burden. See our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.31223/X57M7F) for more information.

### Land Management Scenarios
The SMRT-Flames Tool allows end-users to input custom land management scenarios. Below are a few example land management scenarios as described in Chung et al. (submitted) for optimizing targets for land management (prescribed burns and fuel treatments) and evaluating benefits on the receptor population's smoke burden. We use a land management intensity (LMI) value to design these scenarios. LMI ranges from 0 to 1: a LMI of 0 is no land management, while a LMI is 1 is no fire emissions due to aggressive treatment.

| Scenario | Type | Description | Acres Treated | SMRT-Flames Mode |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| NFPORS + FRAP | Historical | Combined federal and state prescribed burns from NFPORS and FRAP from December 2017 to June 2020 | 285,955 | Variable
| Risk-optimized (15, High) | Hypothetical | 15 highest-risk grid cells (according to the smoke risk index), treated with LMI = 0.5 | 30,000 | Target
| Risk-optimized (100, Medium) | Hypothetical | 100 highest-risk grid cells, treated with LMI = 0.25 (1,000 acres per grid cell) | 100,000 | Target 
| Risk-optimized (50, High) | Hypothetical | 50 highest-risk grid cells, treated with LMI = 0.5 (2,000 acres per grid cell) | 100,000 | Target

Note: NFPORS is the National Fire Plan Operations and Reporting System and FRAP is the Fire and Resource Assessment Program. NFPORS is operated at the federal level by the US Forest Service and FRAP includes state-level efforts with CAL FIRE involvement. LMI is the land management intensity.

There are two modes for inputting land management scenarios in the SMRT-Flames Tool: 'Targeted' and 'Variable'. Users need to input a specified format in the tool on Earth Engine Apps, as described here:
- "Targeted": Enter an array in the format of \[n grid cells,LMI\], indicating how the top x number of grid cells in smoke exposure contribution to target at a specified land management intensity (LMI), ranging from 0-1.

Risk-optimized scenario (15, High)
```
[15,0.5]
```
Risk-optimized scenario (100, Medium)
```
[100,0.25]
```
Risk-optimized scenario (50, High)
```
[50,0.5]
```
- "Variable": Enter a list in the format of [[lon,lat,LMI],..], where LMI = land management intensity (0 = no land management, 1 = complete land management efficacy / fire prevention).
